# Morgan Stanley Code to Give 2025 @ Hong Kong

## Problem Statment
Design and develop a centralized, real-time, collaborative digital platform that offers resources and guidance needed for parents to 
actively participate in their child's educational development. Include these features: 
 
1. The solution should work like a centralized digital platform to host all learning materials and allow parents to upload 
completed work, forming a student portfolio to help staff monitor progress, give feedback, and keep parents aligned with 
the childâ€™s learning journey. 
2. Having a gamified point-based system to encourage timely homework uploads by rewarding parents and children. 
Points will appear on a school-wide leaderboard, promoting friendly competition and recognizing consistent effort with 
tangible rewards.
