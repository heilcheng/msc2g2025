# Morgan Stanley Code to Give 2025 @ Hong Kong

## Problem Statment
Design and develop a centralized, real-time, collaborative digital platform that offers resources and guidance needed for parents to 
actively participate in their child's educational development. Include these features: 
 
1. The solution should work like a centralized digital platform to host all learning materials and allow parents to upload 
completed work, forming a student portfolio to help staff monitor progress, give feedback, and keep parents aligned with 
the child’s learning journey. 
2. Having a gamified point-based system to encourage timely homework uploads by rewarding parents and children. 
Points will appear on a school-wide leaderboard, promoting friendly competition and recognizing consistent effort with 
tangible rewards.

A web application designed to facilitate English learning for K3 children through parent-child collaboration, volunteer support, and NGO administration.

## Overview
<img width="480" height="400" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-24 at 11 15 24 pm" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e1f1402-686e-4dc0-981d-a9feac6a8197" />


This platform connects multiple stakeholders in the English learning ecosystem:
- **Students & Parents**: Interactive learning activities and progress tracking
- **Volunteers**: Community support and mentoring system
- **NGO Administrators**: Comprehensive management and analytics dashboard

## Features

### For Parents and Students
<img width="480" height="480" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-24 at 10 59 28 pm" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b30bf3d-1b4c-4f81-b554-f2a045b23f77" />


**Socratic-like AI & teacher feedback integration**: I use Ollama + LLaVA:7B to power multimodal AI grading: a lightweight yet effective vision-language model that reads K3 students’ worksheets more accurately than traditional OCR-only pipelines, while also generating meaningful AI feedback for parents!
- **Personalized Dashboard**: Weekly missions, AI-generated daily challenges, and clear progress indicators
- **Progress Tracking**: Skills radar chart, worksheet submission records
- **Forums**: Forums, resources, Quora-like Q&A section for parents
- **Duolingo-like Leaderboard System & Habitica-like RPG Gamification**: Parent-child team competition, co-op missions, avatars, and social reactions


### For Volunteers

**Rewards System ([Time Auction](https://timeauction.org/)):**  
Volunteers earn service hours by assisting low-income families with homework guidance. These hours can be redeemed via [Time Auction](https://timeauction.org/): a charity platform where volunteer hours are exchanged for real-life rewards, such as mentorship sessions with professionals, unique experiences, and public recognition. This creates a sustainable incentive model where volunteers give back, families benefit, and NGOs can track impact.
- **Volunteer Dashboard**: Service hour tracking, personal contribution stats, AI-suggested families to help
- **Builds a sustainable cycle**: volunteers give back, families benefit, and NGOs track impact


### For NGO Administrators

I analyze student data to identify those who are falling behind or whose parents have not used the app for a while; in such cases, NGO volunteers reach out to provide support and improve engagement.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Student watchlist, parent engagement monitor, KPI visualization for donors
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Regional learning trends, subject performance comparison, intervention alert system for students who cannot catch up
